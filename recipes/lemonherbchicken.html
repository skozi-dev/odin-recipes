    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Picture a plate adorned with succulent grilled chicken breasts, each infused with the bright zest of lemons and
      the aromatic dance of Mediterranean herbs. As your fork glides through the tender, perfectly grilled meat, a burst
      of citrusy aroma fills the air, teasing your taste buds and invoking a sense of pure culinary delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lemon, both in zest and juice, lends a refreshing tang, enhancing the natural flavors of the tender chicken.
      With every bite, you taste the sun-soaked herbs – the earthiness of oregano and the subtle minty notes of thyme –
      mingling harmoniously with the charred perfection from the grill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surface of the chicken is adorned with grill marks, a testament to the expert grilling technique that locks in
      juices and imparts a delightful smokiness. Each mouthful is a symphony of textures – the slight crunch on the
      outside and the juicy tenderness within, creating a culinary experience that dances on your palate.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 Boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>Zest and juice of 2 lemons</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
      <li>Salt and Black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
      <li>Lemon slices (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Marinate the Chicken</b>
        <p>
          In a bowl, combine lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried thyme, salt, and
          black pepper. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Cover and
          refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and infuse the chicken.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Preheat the Grill</b>
        <p>
          Preheat your grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Brush the grates lightly with oil to prevent sticking.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Grill the Chicken</b>
        <p>
          Remove the chicken from the marinade and let excess marinade drip off. Grill the chicken breasts for 6-7
          minutes per side or until they are cooked through and have beautiful grill marks. The chicken should reach an
          internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rest and Garnish</b>
        <p>
          Transfer the grilled chicken to a plate and let it rest for a few minutes. This allows the juices to
          redistribute, ensuring a moist and flavorful bite. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley for a burst of color
          and a hint of added freshness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Serve with Elegance</b>
        <p>
          Arrange the grilled chicken on a platter, garnish with lemon slices, and serve. The vibrant aroma of lemon and
          herbs will tantalize your senses, and the first bite will transport you to the sunny coastlines of the
          Mediterranean.
