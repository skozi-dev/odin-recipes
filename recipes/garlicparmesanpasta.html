    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the pasta</b>
        <p>
          Boil the fettucine pasta in a large pot of salted water until al dente according to the package instructions.
          Drain and set aside, reserving a cup of pasta water.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Make the Sauce</b>
        <p>
          In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2
          minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Add the Cream</b>
        <p>
          Pour in the heavy cream, stirring constantly. Let the mixture simmer gently for 2-3 minutes, allowing it to
          thicken slightly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Add Cheese and Seasoning</b>
        <p>
          Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese, stirring continuously until the cheese is melted and the sauce is
          smooth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a bit of the reserved
          pasta water to reach your desired consistency.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Combine Pasta and Sauce</b>
        <p>
          Add the cooked fettuccine to the sauce. Toss gently to coat the pasta evenly with the creamy garlic Parmesan
          sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Serve and Garnish</b>
        <p>
          Divide the pasta among plates. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and an extra sprinkle of Parmesan cheese if
          desired.
        </p>
      </li>
