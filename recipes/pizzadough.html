    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
      <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Activate the yeast</b>
        <p>
          In a small bowl, combine warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5
          minutes, until it becomes frothy. This magic moment signals the yeast is ready to transform your ingredients
          into doughy perfection.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mixing the magic</b>
        <p>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture
          and olive oil. Using a sturdy spatula or your hands, mix the ingredients until they come together into a
          shaggy dough.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Kneading Nirvana</b>
        <p>
          Transfer the dough onto a floured surface. Knead it for about 8-10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and
          elastic. Feel the dough respond to your touch, becoming more supple and promising the perfect pizza texture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Rising to Greatness</b>
        <p>
          Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm, cozy spot for
          1-1.5 hours. Watch as it doubles in size, absorbing the essence of the yeast and the anticipation of becoming
          your culinary canvas.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Divide and Conquer</b>
        <p>
          After the dough has risen, punch it down gently to release any air bubbles. Divide it into the desired number
          of pizza crusts. Roll out each portion into your preferred thickness and shape, be it a classic circle or a
          rustic rectangle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bake Your Dreams</b>
        <p>
          Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Add your favorite sauce, cheese, and toppings. Bake your creation on a
          preheated pizza stone or a baking sheet for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese
          is bubbling into a heavenly mosaic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Savor the Moment</b>
        <p>
          Pull your masterpiece from the oven and marvel at the golden crust, the melty cheese, and the enticing aroma
          filling your kitchen. Slice, share, and savor each bite of your homemade pizza, a testament to your culinary
          prowess and the magic of homemade dough.
